### Shared Responsibility in the Cloud

Cloud computing offers a spectrum of services, each with a different level of shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the customer. Here's a breakdown:

Shared Responsibility Model: This model outlines the division of security and management tasks between the cloud provider and the customer. While the cloud provider secures the underlying infrastructure (physical security, network security), the customer is responsible for securing its data, applications, and access controls within the cloud environment.
	

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Cloud Provider Responsibility: Physical infrastructure (servers, storage), Network security and Underlying virtualization platform	

Customer Responsibility: Operating system, Security of applications and data, and Access controls within the virtual machines

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Cloud Provider Responsibility: Underlying infrastructure, Platform and middleware, Runtime environment and Operating system updates

Customer Responsibility: Security of applications and data, Access controls within the platform and Application code deployment and management

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)
Cloud Provider Responsibility: Entire application and infrastructure, Data security at rest and in transit, and Application updates and maintenance	

Customer Responsibility: User access controls within the application, and Data within the application itself

##### Remember: The key takeaway is that the level of customer responsibility increases as you move from SaaS (least) to IaaS (most).
Choosing the Right Cloud Service: When to Use IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

Here are three scenarios to illustrate when each service model might be the best fit:

### Scenario 1: IaaS (For Maximum Control and Flexibility):

Your company is a large financial institution with strict compliance requirements and needs complete control over its infrastructure.

You require a high degree of customization for your applications and want to manage your own operating systems and security configurations.

IaaS provides the raw resources and control needed to build a secure, compliant cloud environment tailored to your specific needs.

### Scenario 2: PaaS (For Faster Development and Scalability):

Your company is a startup developing a new mobile application.

You need a platform that allows for rapid development and deployment without managing the underlying infrastructure.

PaaS offers a pre-configured platform with built-in features and tools that can streamline your development process and ensure easy scaling as your application grows.

### Scenario 3: SaaS (For Cost-Effectiveness and Ease of Use):

Your company needs a simple email solution for its employees.

You don't want to manage any servers or software yourself.

SaaS offers a readily available and user-friendly email application accessible from any device, requiring minimal setup and ongoing maintenance.
